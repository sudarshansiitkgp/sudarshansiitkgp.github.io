I am Sudarshan Shyam, a PhD student at Aarhus University. I have the pleasure of being advised by Ioannis Caragiannis. I am broadly interested in all areas of Theoretical Computer Science and most areas of math.

A long time ago, I graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur with a bachelor's degree and from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California San Diego with a master's degree. I worked in the industry at Amazon and Microsoft for a couple of years before getting back to academia.
